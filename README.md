# Advanced-Number-Guesser

# In this program, I utilize features such as writing to a txt file, and classes to complete this code. How it works is a username is taken in, and the game starts. This program takes the total amount of guesses that it took for you to get the right number, and multiplies it by 100 to get a final score (lower scores are better,  akin to golf). The players name and score are stored in a tuple and are arranged in a txt file named scoreboard.txt. This scoreboard acts like a leaderboard, putting the lower scores at the top.
